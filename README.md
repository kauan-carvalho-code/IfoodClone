## Technologies used

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) language adds static typing to JavaScript, which originally has dynamic typing.

[Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/) is a library for React and React Native that allows you to use component-level styles in your application. They are written in a mixture of JavaScript and CSS.

[Eslint](https://eslint.org/) is a code analysis tool that, together with its extension of the same name available in VSCode, allows us to identify errors regarding the writing pattern we define.

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and reprinting it with its own rules that take into account the maximum line length, wrapping the code when necessary.

[Next JS] (https://nextjs.org) Next.js gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.
